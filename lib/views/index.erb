      The register includes energy performance certificates for residential and non-residential buildings, display
      energy
      certificates for public authority buildings, and air conditioning inspection reports for air conditioning
      systems

      An energy performance certificate is required for properties when constructed, sold or let. The energy
      performance
      certificate provides details on the energy performance of the property and what you can do to improve it.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Almost 40% of the UKâ€™s energy consumption and carbon emissions come from the way our buildings are lit,
      heated and used. Even comparatively small changes in energy performance and the way we use each building
      will have a significant effect in reducing total energy consumption.
